# Predict Housing Prices
- Build a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on property characteristics. Explore how features like location, size, and condition impact the price.
- This project is inspired from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data), use **linear regression** to train and model predictions.
- The expected results will be saved on the `submission.csv` file
- You can download the code for this project [here](https://github.com/nghiands/house_predict/blob/main/Predict%20Housing%20Prices/house_price_predict.ipynb)
